ABOUT ME (●'◡'●)

Hi there, I'm Vanessa! 👋

Neuroscience graduate, BCI developer, and AI software engineer creating advanced NeuroAI technologies that enhance human cognition, therapy, and interaction.

I spend my days designing **real-time EEG pipelines, neurofeedback applications, and emotion-aware systems** using **Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, embedded devices, and cloud platforms**. I enjoy taking **research ideas and turning them into user-centered, practical neurotechnologies** that have a real-world impact.
